AzeriteUI 5.3 is a custom World of Warcraft user interface for Classic Era, Season of Discovery and TBC Anniversary.

## Downloading & Installing
I recommend downloading the UI from either [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/azeriteui) or [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/azeriteui), or use their respective download clients which provides the same versions and installs them automatically for you. Be aware that only these download locations provide finished packaged addons with all libraries included.

If you choose to download and manually install directly from GitHub, you'll have to install the following libraries as standalones in order for the UI to work. Note that the folder you should copy to the relevant WoW AddOn directory is the folder that has a .toc file in it, and the folder must be renamed to have the same name as the .toc file without its file ending:

## Configuring the UI
- **/azerite** or **/az** - Toggles the options menu.
- **/lock** - Toggles the movable frame anchors. *(Note that in Retail a lot of the default Blizzard elements are controlled by the EditMode, so you need to enter it to move or scale these.)*
- **/resetsettings** - Full settings reset of the addon. Only use this in emergencies as it will erase all your settings profiles when doing it.

Note the amount of people visibly and monthly pledging is directly equivalent to the amount of time and effort I put into investigating bugs and adding features that does not affect me personally. You're dedicated, I'm dedicated.
