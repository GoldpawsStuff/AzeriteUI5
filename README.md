AzeriteUI5.1 is a custom World of Warcraft user interface for Dragonflight, Wrath Classic and Classic Era.

## Downloading & Installing
I recommend downloading the UI from either [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/azeriteui) or [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/azeriteui), or use their respective download clients which provides the same versions and installs them automatically for you. I do not recommend using untagged git versions as they can contain bugged or unfishined code, nor will I be providing any help on how to install them for this very reasons.

## FAQ
- **Q:** How can I remove abilities from the action bars?
- **A:** Hold down `Alt`+`Ctrl`+`Shift` and drag with the left mouse button.

## Configuring the UI
- **/azerite** - Toggles the options menu.
- **/lock** - Toggles the movable frame anchors. *(Note that in Retail a lot of the default Blizzard elements are controlled by the EditMode, so you need to enter it to move or scale these.)*
- **/resetsettings** - Full settings reset of the addon. Only use this in emergencies as it will erase all your settings profiles when doing it.
